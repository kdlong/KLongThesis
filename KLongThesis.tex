\documentclass[oneside, letterpaper, 12pt, oldfontcommands]{memoir}

%%%% Import uwthesis.sty to get official formatting, then set your variables.

%\section{Dedication}
%This thesis is dedicated to the memory of Dr. David Murdock, whose
%passion for physics and education helped countless students
%at Tennessee Technological University and far beyond. Your love of
%particle physics spread to me, and your generosity with your time and knowledge
%gave me the tools to be successful beyond the walls of Tennessee Tech.
