%%%% You should be using the memoir class anyway; it makes life easier:

\section{Dedication}
This thesis is dedicated to the memory of Dr. David Murdock, whose
passion for physics and education helped countless students
at Tennessee Technological University and far beyond. Your love of
particle physics spread to me, and your generosity with your time and knowledge
gave me the tools to be successful beyond the walls of Tennessee Tech.
