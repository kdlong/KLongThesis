\chapter{Introduction}

This thesis presents a measurement of W and Z vector boson production, 
decaying leptonically and associated
with two forward and high momentum jets, produced in proton-proton collisions
at the CERN LHC. The contribution to this process dominated by fully electroweak (EW)
interactions is extracted and measured with an observed significance of
1.9$\sigma$, with 2.7$\sigma$ expected. This is the first measurement
of this process at CMS. 

This EW contribution to this process is intimately connected to the 
phenomenon of EW symmetry breaking (EWSB) \cite{WZinclusive13TeV}, which gives rise to masses of
the vector bosons and their self-interactions. A fundamental prediction
of EWSB is the presence of a scalar particle, referred 
to as the Higgs boson, which was first observed by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations
at CERN in 2012~\cite{}.
