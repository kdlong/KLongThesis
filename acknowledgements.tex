\section{Acknowledgements}

With the dust settling nearly six years 
of constant scrambling to acquire and apply new knowledge and ideas,
there is finally a brief window to hold off on looking forward
to what is still to be done and to instead look back on what I have 
accomplished. Most importantly, I must thank the many people who have
enabled me to arrive in this position. First and foremost, I am grateful
to my wonderful wife, Emily. You have showed boundless
personal strength and independence while being a constant pillar of 
support for me. I cannot thank you enough.

Thank you to my parents, for 

My grandfather, Kenneth Buchanan, deserves a special mention. Your curiosity
and deep appreciation for the pursuit of knowledge,
from working is a wonderful example.


I have been a student for the vast majority of my life. Thank you to all the
teachers who have made this time well spent. To my first physics and astronomy teachers,
Mr. Garrett and Mr. Pencarinha, who guided me in the direction of my interests
Thank you to those who played a 

My advisor, Professor Matt Herndon, deserves 
You are a great physicist, a thoughtful and attentive supervisor,
and a genuine and . You gave me close guidance and attentive support, but
also allowed me the indepedence to pursue my own ideas and interests.

The Wisconsin CMS group is a wonderfully collaborative environment,
and I was lucky to benefit from the deep knowledge and profession examples
of Professors Sridhara Dasu, Wesley Smith, Tulika Bose, and Kevin Black. 
Thank you to Sridhara and Wesley for holding me to the same standards 
as your own students. Following his retirement in 2018, 
I am particularly grateful that I have benefited 
from the vast knowledge and experience of Professor Wesley Smith.
Your steadfast commitment to work that is both rigorously
supported and carefully communicated is inspiring.

Thank you to Sascha Savin for providing a constant example of scientific
rigor and passion.  
I am grateful (perhaps more so in hindsight) for your tireless push
towards rigorous and rapid advancement, often realized by daily Skype
messages.
Thank you especially to Senka Duric, who was always supportive and
encouraging. Working alongside talented, 

The CMS Collaboration is built from the work of thousands of physicists,
without whom this thesis would not begin to be possible. Thank you to
my collaborators at MIT, Princeton, and Fermilab for pushing the quality
and scope of this work forward.
The CMS generators group deserves a special acknowledgement
for cultivating an environment that placed scientific merit above
seniority and established conventions---thank you in particular to Josh
Bendavid, Pietro Govoni, and Luca Perozzi. 
Thank you also to the members of the CMS CSC group, particularly those
who helped me navigate the terrors of being the first line of defense
against problems with data collection in the middle of the night,
especially Jian Wang and Misha Ignatenko.

Lastly, thank you to all my friends in the Madison and Geneva areas
who provided a welcome respite from the pressures and challenges of
research, teaching, and classes. From my fellow classmates, to my friends from cycling and
the CERN Football Club, I have met wonderful people who stand out
as much for their generosity and caring as for their incredible talents
and intellect. I would like to thank you all by name, but I would
risk leaving someone out.
