A measurement
of the simultaneous production of a $\PW$ and a $\PZ$ boson ($\WZ$ production)
via vector boson scattering is presented.
The measurement is performed in the leptonic decay modes $\WZ \to \ell\nu\ell'\ell'$,
where $\ell, \ell'$ indicate an electron or muon.
The analysis is based on a data sample of proton-proton
collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13\TeV$ at the 
CERN Large Hadron Collider collected with the 
Compact Muon Solenoid detector and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $35.9\fbinv$.
The \WZ plus two jet production cross section
is measured in fiducial regions with enhanced contributions from
electroweak (EW) production and found to be consistent with standard model predictions.
The \EWWZ production in association with two jets is measured with an observed (expected) significance of 2.2 (2.5) standard deviations.
Results are also interpreted in terms of physics beyond the standard model modifying the 
interactions of the $\PW$ and $\PZ$ bosons.
Constraints on charged Higgs boson production and on anomalous quartic gauge couplings in terms of
dimension-eight effective field theory operators are presented.
