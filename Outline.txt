1) Introduction

Introduction to the field of particle physics, and understanding the simplest
forms of matter as a means to understanding physical phenomena. 
The historical development of the SM and the role of this analysis 
in confirming predictions of the SM and testing possible extensions.

2) Vector boson scattering in the Standard Model and beyond 
-- The Standard Model
-- Electroweak symmetry breaking
-- Multi-Vector boson interactions 
-- Probing the electroweak sector through vector boson scattering 
-- New interactions in vector boson scattering
  -- Additional Higgs bosons and the Georgi-Machacek model
  -- Generalizing new interactions with effective field theory

Introduce the essential elements of the standard model as it stands today,
with particular emphasize on VBS, its role in testing SM predictions,
and why it is sensitive to new physics effects. Discussion of the
New Physics models probed in this result.

3) The CMS Experiment at the CERN LHC
-- The Large Hadron Collider
-- Operation of the LHC in 2016
-- The Compact Muon Solenoid Experiment
-- The CMS Magnet
-- The CMS silicon tracking system
-- The CMS Electromagnetic Calorimeter
-- The CMS Hadronic Calorimeter
-- The CMS Muon System
  -- Drift Tube System
  -- Resistive Plate Chamber system
  -- Cathode Strip Chamber system

Introduce the LHC and the CMS experiment, giving attention
to the CSC system and the LHC running conditions
for the dataset used in this thesis.

4) Theoretical predictions and event simulation 
-- Anatomy of an LHC collision
-- Perturbative calculations and matrix element generators
-- Parton distribution functions
-- Predictions from fixed-order calculations
-- Event Simulation for Experimental Analysis 
  -- The Parton Shower and matching to matrix element calculations
  -- Underlying Event, Hadronization, and Decay
  -- Detector Simulation

Discuss calculations for LHC physics in both the comparison/interpretation of results
context and in the context of using these inputs with full detector simulation
for analysis. The latter will be primarily emphasized.

5) Event Reconstruction 
-- Global event description via particle flow 
  -- Tracks and vertices
  -- Calorimeter clusters
  -- Particle flow candidates
-- Physics objects
  -- Muons
  -- Electrons
  -- Charged and neutral hadrons
  -- Jets
    -- b-jet identification
-- Missing transverse momentum

Introduce physics objects used in this analysis. Start with description
of detector information input to form particle flow objects
before discussing reconstruction algorithms, ID, and selections for
physics objects used.

6) Analysis strategy
  -- WZ VBS event signature and background composition
  -- Event triggering
  -- Event selection
    -- WZjj cross section, EW WZ and aQGC search
    -- Charged Higgs boson search
  -- Background contributions
    -- Estimation of nonprompt backgrounds
    -- Simulation and validation of prompt backgrounds

8) Conclusions
-- Summary of Results
-- Future Prospects

Summary and discussion of future sensitivity, especially for
full Run II analysis, HL-LHC, and sensitivity to polarization studies.
